    "background": "Era was a student of Loremaster Oris, tasked with chronicling Astoran history. Her curiosity led her to secretly document the abilities of living creatures, developing a unique magic that allowed her to replicate the skills she observed. Censured by her isolationist elders, she has ventured to the surface to prove that the world is a library, and every monster a book.",
    "narrative_hook": "Era's quest to document the world's creatures puts her at odds with factions who would rather see them exploited or exterminated, such as the Arcane Dominion. Her unique magical abilities may also attract unwanted attention from those who see her as a threat or a tool."

On a **10+**, you perfectly capture its essence; add the ability to your codex. On a **7-9**, you capture it, but the transcription is flawed: it will be weaker, unstable, or require a strange component to use. On a **6-**, you fail to grasp it and the feedback leaves you mentally vulnerable until you can clear your head."
