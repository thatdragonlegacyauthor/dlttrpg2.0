        "description": "You stand before the immense, sun-bleached marble facade of the Elysian Grand Cathedral. The architecture is a marvel of perfect symmetry and soaring arches, designed to inspire both awe and a sense of insignificance. Massive, silver-inlaid doors stand open, inviting all to enter. The only sounds are the perfectly timed chimes of a distant bell and the crisp, synchronized marching of Champion patrols on the plaza.",

Massive stained-glass windows depict scenes of Elysia's benevolence, casting long, colorful rays of light across the perfectly polished white floor. The air is cool and smells of incense and sterile stone. The atmosphere is one of profound silence and cold, imposing order. Patrols of Champions march with rigid precision.",

Clean, white cots are arranged in perfect rows, and healers in pristine robes tend to the sick and injured from nearby villages. The air is filled with the soft chanting of restorative hymns. It is a place of genuine succor, though the healers' devotion to Elysian doctrine is absolute and unsettling.",

A massive, stone map of Eryndor covers the entire floor, with glowing runes representing troop movements and areas of chaotic influence. High-ranking Inquisitors and Knights plan their crusades here. The walls are bare, save for a single, massive banner bearing Elysia's symbol: a perfect, golden circle.",
