This is the heart of the dormant volcano, and the air here is a shimmering curtain of heat and raw, elemental power. A narrow, treacherous path leads down into the caldera itself.",

In the center of the platform, the Ashen Priest stands before a colossal, draconic effigy of obsidian and fire, performing a dark ritual. His chanting fills the cavern, and a palpable wave of heat and chaotic energy radiates from him.",
