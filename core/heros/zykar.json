During a containment breach, a human soul was accidentally transferred into his chassis, awakening him with sentience. He escaped, relentlessly hunted by his former masters. He roams the land, searching for clues to his past life and a fierce, unspoken need to protect something he canâ€™t quite remember.",

Once per session, he can use a **Soul Engine** move as if he had rolled a 10+, without marking Harm. This moment of psychic harmony also grants Rya focus; she may ask the GM one question from the Investigate or Survey list as a free action."
