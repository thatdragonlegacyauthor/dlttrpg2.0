Selraâ€™s faith was shattered when she witnessed the Champions of Order's brutal attack on Windmark. The cruelty of their purge was a direct contradiction to everything she had ever believed. Now, traveling with Rya, she is a lost pilgrim, struggling to reconcile her faith with the injustice she has seen.",
    "narrative_hook": "Selra is torn between her deeply held faith in Elysia's goodness and the increasingly cruel actions of the Champions. Her personal quest is to find a balance between order and compassion, and to define her own faith."
