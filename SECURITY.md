# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you've found a security issue, please do not open a public issue. Instead:
- Email the repository owner via the email listed on the GitHub profile, or
- Open a private security advisory if available, or
- As a last resort, open an issue with minimal detail and request a private channel.

We'll acknowledge your report within 72 hours and aim to provide an initial assessment within a week.
