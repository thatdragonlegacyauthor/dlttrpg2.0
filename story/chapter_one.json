        "plot": "Using the intel from Rhys, the party deduces that Valerius is not seeking the Well of Souls for its own power, but as a staging ground for an assault on Stonegard to seize the draconic relics in the Dragon's Graveyard. The party must race to warn the isolationist Scalebound Clans.",
        "conflict": "The party must first get past the deeply suspicious Stonekin guards and convince the clan elders of the imminent threat. The climax is a multi-stage battle to defend Stonegard. The party will be tasked with a critical objective, such as holding a key chokepoint in the pass, sabotaging Champion siege weapons, or dueling one of Valerius's lieutenants to break the morale of the attacking force.",
        "outcome": "The Champions' initial assault is repelled. While Valerius is not defeated, his plans are thwarted. The party's actions earn them the grudging respect and a temporary alliance with the powerful Scalebound Clans. The chapter concludes with the party having successfully forged their group into a capable unit and secured their first major allies in the fight to come."
